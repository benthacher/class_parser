# Class Parser

Adds classes from Northeastern schedule to calendar as events.

## Usage

The "Add Classes" button must only be pressed on the banner schedule website, accessed through the myNortheastern portal.
- Click on schedule, then select the desired term to be added from the dropdown list.
- Once the schedule has loaded, click the extension icon in the top right section of chrome and click Add Classes.
- An authentication window will pop up and ask for the account that you want to add the calendar to. Once your account has been linked, the extension will add the events to your calendar.
- Any errors that occur will be logged in the container below the button.
